<h1><br>

 Slide Lab</h1>

<h2>Introduction:</h2>
  
 <p class="w3-large"> In this lab, we attempted to find the frictional coefficient between a slide and the shirt of Gali. We did this in order to reinforce our understanding of 2d kinematics and also friction. My hypothesis was the the slide and Gali's shirt would have roughly a frictional coefficient of 0.4, which seems like a not that slippery.</p>
  <p> The equation we used to find the legnth of the slide was the pythagorean theorem, h^2+l^2=x^2. The Equation we used to find the angle of the slide was theta = arctan(high/across). The equation we used to find the coefficient of fricion was a= g sin(theta) - mk (g(cos(theta)) and to find a we used length =  1/2at^2</p>

<h2>Materials:</h2>  
<ul class="d">
  <li>Notebook</li>
  <li>Slider and recorder(these are people)</li>
  <li>Stopwatch</li>
  <li>Measuring tape</li>
  <li>Slide</li>
</ul>

  
<h2>Procedure:</h2>
<ol class="a">
  <li>Have one person measure the height and legnth of the slide, and get out a notebook to record it</li>
  <li>Slider goes to the top of the slide, and releases to go down it at the same time that the stopwatch starts</li>
  <li>When the person reaches the bottom of the slide stop the stopwatch and record the time</li>
  <li>repeat steps 2-3 20 times</li>
  <li>Repeat steps 5-7 with the rest of your masses. There should be 10 measurements total per object you are testing, one per mass that you add.</li>
  <li>Repeat all measurements for each object to be tested. Again, there should be 10 masses total which are coupled with each object, so that each object has 10 measurements made.</li>

</ol>

<h2> Data and Analysis: </h2>

<p> After sliding Gali down the slide 20 times 
</p>
<img src="slideLab.pdf" alt="Slide Lab" width="700" height="700"> 
<p> As seen in the calculations, the final coefficient of kinetic friction was 0.28
</p>
  <h2> Error Analysis: </h2>
  
<p class="w3-large"> Possible errors could include timing with stopwatches which could be fixed by an automatic release system or Tori just getting really lucky. Another main issue could be my release from the top going down on the slide which could also be fixed by the automatic release system. Lastly, the slide was kind of curved which could definetely throw off acceleration and that could be fixed with a new slide.</p>

  <h2> Conclusion: </h2>
 <p class="w3-large"> In conclusion, the slide had a little bit less friction than I expected, but 0.28 compared to my hypothesised 0.4 also seems like a really good balance between going and not hurting yourself. The real world applications of being able to measure coefficient of friction has uses like tires, clothing technology, sports, and as seen by the experiment, slides. </p>
