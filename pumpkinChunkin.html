<h2>Introduction:</h2>
  
 <p class="w3-large">In this lab we attempted to increase our understanding of projectile motion by trying to find the optimal launch angle for projectiles. We did this by throwing pumpkins and using their change in height and displacement as well as time to find their launch angle. The launch angle was then correlated to the displacement of the pumpkin in order to find which angle went the furthest. We hypothesized that the optimal launch angle would be 45 degrees because it would have equal x and y velocity.  </p>
  <p> The equation we used to find launch angle was theta = arctan(-g(t^2)/2Δx) </p>

<h2>Materials:</h2>  
<ul class="d">
  <li>Small Pumpkin</li>
  <li>Stopwatch(can be phone)</li>
  <li>Distance measuring apparatus</li>
  <li>Thrower</li>
  <li>Method to record times and distances</li>
</ul>

  
<h2>Procedure:</h2>
<ol class="a">
  <li>Go to an open field with minimal winds</li>
  <li>Have a person lie down on a marked spot and throw as far as they can, making sure the initial height of the pumpkin is touching the floor</li>
  <li>Start a timer when the pumpkin leaves the ground and pause when the pumpkin reaches the ground once more</li>
  <li>Measure the distance from the marked spot to the spot where the pumpkin first touched the ground</li>
  <li>Record the aforementioned distance in meters and the time in seconds</li>
  <li>Repeat steps II to V 5-20 times</li>
  <li>Calculate launch angle using theta = arctan(-g(t^2)/2Δx) for each recorded distance and time </li>

</ol>
