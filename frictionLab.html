  <br>
  Friction Lab</h1>

<h2>Introduction:</h2>
  
 <p class="w3-large"> In this lab we explored whether or not banana peels are more slippery than other things to learn the nature of friction, and how the intensity of it is inherent to the material being tested. We tested the kinetic frictional force of a banana vs scissors vs an eraser. My hypothesis was that the banana would be less slippery than the scissors but more than the eraser.</p>
  <p> The equation we used to find the coefficient of fricion was ùö∫F=ma=‚àÖN=Fpull-Ffr or Fpull = Ffr = uk(mg) </p>

<h2>Materials:</h2>  
<ul class="d">
  <li>Electronic Scale</li>
  <li>Spring Scale</li>
  <li>various 20g masses</li>
  <li>Banana peel</li>
  <li>Eraser</li>
  <li>Scissors</li>
  <li>Person to pull at a constant rate</li>
  <li>method of recording readings from spring scale</li>
</ul>

  
<h2>Procedure:</h2>
<ol class="a">
  <li>Measure the mass of each object alone, without masses added to them, and record them.</li>
  <li>Place one of your masses on top of one of your testing objects. Record the total mass of your experimental object.</li>
  <li>Attach the spring scale to the mass/object combination.</li>
  <li>Pull the mass/object combination on a flat cement surface at a constant velocity. Record the reading on the spring scale (in Newtons).</li>
  <li>Repeat steps 5-7 with the rest of your masses. There should be 10 measurements total per object you are testing, one per mass that you add.</li>
  <li>Repeat all measurements for each object to be tested. Again, there should be 10 masses total which are coupled with each object, so that each object has 10 measurements made.</li>

</ol>

<h2> Data and Analysis: </h2>

<p> After Pumpkin some Chunkin we found the following results using theta = arctan(-g(t^2)/2Œîx) and calculating velocity initial with vo=Œîx/cosŒòt. It is important to note that Delta(x) is in meters

 <p class="w3-large"> Despite some inconsistencies, the data, especially the trendline shows that just around the middle(45 degrees) is the relative maximum for delta x and both increasing and decreasing that minimizes the displacement. </p>

  <h2> Error Analysis: </h2>
  
<p class="w3-large"> Our thrower, although pretty consistent for a person, did not have identical initial velocities per throw, which meant that it was harder to judge whether a far throw was due to angle or high initial velocity. This could be fixed with a throwing apparatus like one of the ones they use for tennis. Another issue was that throws did not perfectly start at y = 0, affecting the calculations. This could be fixed by accounting for the change in height in our calculations, or by digging a small hole for the aforementioned throwing apparatus to have its throw set at y = 0. Lastly, there was likely a difference between the actual distance and measured time to ours due to limitations of reaction time and our measuring device. This could be fixed by exponentially more rigorous methods of measuring based off of how exact we want to get. The percent error is calculated by % Error = |actual-expected|/actual x 100% and ours resulted in 2.22% = |45-44|/45 x 100%. This is because our greatest throw was at 44 degrees and the actual ideal throwing angle is 45 degrees.</p>

  <h2> Conclusion: </h2>
 <p class="w3-large"> In conclusion, the furthest throw was almost 45 degrees, coming in at a solid 44. Although this throw also had a higher initial velocity, it matched our hypothesis that the furthest throw would be that at a 45 degree angle. The ability to maximise distance for angle has many real world applications, from playing a sport and wanting to throw as far as possible. If I were to explain why 45 degrees is the optimal angle, I would hypothesize that it is because the x and y velocities are the same initially, maximizing time in the air along with x velocity to increase distance.</p>
