<h1 style="text-align: center;">Mapping the Magnetic Field</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Galileo, [Partner(s)], 3-xx-24</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">(field map visuals were done by hand)</p>

<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>
This lab focused on mapping the magnetic field around permanent magnets. Magnetic fields are vector fields, meaning they have both direction and magnitude. They come from electric charges in motion or from materials like bar magnets. We used small compasses to trace the direction of the magnetic field lines around a single bar magnet, then again with two magnets in different orientations. Magnetic fields move from the north to the south pole of a magnet, and where field lines are close together, the strength is stronger. My hypothesis was that the compass would trace out curved field lines pointing from north to south, never overlapping, and that putting magnets in different configurations would change the shape of the field map.
</p>

<h2>Materials:</h2>
<ul class="d">
  <li>2 Bar Magnets</li>
  <li>11x17 inch Paper (2 sheets)</li>
  <li>Straight pins / push pins</li>
  <li>Sticky tape</li>
  <li>Compass</li>
  <li>Pencil</li>
</ul>

<h2>Procedure:</h2>
<ol class="a">
  <li>Remove any steel/magnetic objects nearby that could interfere with results.</li>
  <li>Use a compass to find and mark the direction of geographic north on the table.</li>
  <li>Stack two sheets of paper and place the bar magnet on top, long-side facing north-south.</li>
  <li>Secure the paper, trace the magnet’s outline, and use the compass to label which end is actually the north magnetic pole (don’t trust the printed label).</li>
  <li>Place the compass at various points around the magnet to trace the magnetic field lines:
    <br>- Align the needle, mark both ends with pencil dots.
    <br>- Move the compass so one hole is on a previous dot, repeat the alignment and marking.
    <br>- Continue the path to map the field line.
  </li>
  <li>Repeat until you have at least 5 field lines total, including ends and sides. Use arrows to show direction of field.</li>
  <li>Use push pins to mark each dot through both pages so you can recreate the map later.</li>
  <li>Repeat the same process for:
    <br>- Two magnets with like poles facing each other.
    <br>- Two magnets with opposite poles facing each other.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Analysis:</h2>
<ol class="d">
  <li><strong>Field Strength Indicator:</strong> The compass needle moved faster and more sharply in strong field areas, so the responsiveness of the compass gave a general idea of magnitude.</li>
  <li><strong>Line Spacing:</strong> Yes — closer lines = stronger field. Especially near the magnet ends.</li>
  <li><strong>Line Crossing:</strong> No — field lines never crossed, since the magnetic field can only have one direction at each point in space.</li>
  <li><strong>Two-Magnet Comparison:</strong>
    <br>- Like poles: field lines pushed away from each other and made a gap between magnets.
    <br>- Opposite poles: field lines connected directly from one magnet to the other in smooth arcs.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p>
This lab let us see magnetic fields in action. We saw that magnetic field lines always point from north to south, they bend depending on nearby fields, and where the field is stronger the lines are packed closer together. The compass was reliable for mapping field direction. The maps were different when magnets faced each other in different ways, which showed how vector fields can add or push away depending on orientation. Overall, this helped show that magnetic fields follow clear rules and can be visualized without fancy tools.
