<h1 style="text-align: center;">Mapping the Magnetic Field</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Galileo, Tori, Alyona, Jackson, 5-08-25</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">field map visuals were done by hand beautifully by Galileo</p>

<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>
In this lab we focused on mapping the vector magnetic fields around permanent magnets. They come in this case from special materials like neodymium or our bar magnets. Our method of mapping involved using small compasses to trace the direction of the magnetic field lines around one bar magnet and again with two more orientation. It isn’t objective which side is North and South but our lines move from the north to the south poles of the magnet, and where the field lines are closer together the field has a stronger magnetic pull. My hypothesis was that the compass would trace out curved lines kind of in the shape of one of those squishy tubes you can get in gift shops with the blue shiny liquid inside.
</p>

<h2>Materials:</h2>
<ul class="d">
  <li>2 Bar Magnets</li>
  <li>A sheet of large paper</li>
  <li>Straight pins / push pins</li>
  <li>Sticky tape</li>
  <li>Compass</li>
  <li>Pencil</li>
</ul>

<h2>Procedure:</h2>
<p>
First clear away from the table top any magnets or iron or steel objects. Place your compass in the middle of the table and determine the direction of north.
</p>
<p>
Stack on top of one another one of the large sheets of paper for each person in your lab group (i.e., for you and one partner, stack two sheets). Put a bar magnet on top of the sheets, orienting the bar magnet so that its long dimension runs north-south. Turn the paper so that its long dimension is roughly perpendicular to the long dimension of the magnet. Look at the figure for clarification. It doesn’t really matter which end of the bar magnet is towards the north, pick either orientation you like.
Use some tape to secure the paper to the table, and trace the outline of the bar magnet with a pen or pencil. Identify (using your compass) which end of the bar magnet is the north pole. (Don’t trust any markings on the magnet, they have been known to be incorrect. Label on your paper which is the north pole of the magnet.
</p>
<p>
Now use your compass to create a map of the magnetic field lines around the magnet. Do this by placing the compass in a starting point (several suggested starting points are shown in the figure as dots), and turning the compass until the needle lines up with the two holes in the base. Once it’s aligned, stick a pencil into each hole and make a dot. Move the compass to one side or the other, but arrange it so one of the holes in the base is directly over one of your pencil dots. Align the needle with the holes and make another pencil dot. Continue this process in both directions to complete the field line. You might wish to connect the dots as you go along, or wait till later. In either case, when you do connect the dots, use an arrowhead to indicate the direction that the north (red) needle of the compass was pointing. Begin again at another convenient starting point and repeat the mapping process several times until you have traced out a few (need not be more than five or so) lines on each side of the magnet and a two or three lines near each end.
</p>
<p>
To allow both you and your partner(s) to have a copy of the field map, use a push pin and poke through the paper at each pencil dot so that you prick the sheet(s) below. This will allow an accurate copy of the original map to be produced.
</p>
<p>
After you’ve done the first map, obtain some fresh sheets of paper and map another case where you orient two bar magnets in a north-south direction, with like poles facing each other.

<h2>Data Analysis:</h2>
<ol class="d">
  <li><strong>Was there anything about the behavior of the compass that would give some indication of the magnitude of the field at the location of the compass? :</strong> The needle of the compass was more responsive in the areas with a stronger magnetic field, so you can find the magnitude based off of how sharply the needle turns.
</li>
  <li><strong>Examine your field maps. Is there a relationship between how closely spaced the lines are and how strong the field (magnitude) is?</strong> Closer lines meant a stronger field, especially right next to the magnet.</li>
  <li><strong>Did it appear that any of the field lines would cross over one another? Explain why: </strong>  Hypothetically the lines shouldn't cross, because any point in a field should only go one direction, but due to some of our errors the field lines crossed sometimes.</li>
  <li><strong>Describe the difference between the like-pole and unlike-pole field maps. </strong>
    <br>- When like poles were near each other the fields sort of pushed at each other and flattened out in the middle, with the needle not really knowing where to go in the middle area.
    <br>- When opposite poles were near each other the fields connected, with the needle tracing arcs between the magnets.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Error Analysis:</h2>
<p>
  There could have been many sources of error in the field maps such as magnetic materials nearby, and obviously earth’s big field when the compass was too far from the magnet. The compasses were slightly off sometimes, pointing a little bit slanted or not being super receptive to the field. We also could have made an error in reading the compass, as minor deviations cause completely different field lines. We could have fixed all of these things by completely removing all magnetic materials from the classroom or going into a more controlled environment outside of the field of Earth. We would have a much stronger bar magnet and perhaps a grid of compasses so that tracing is not an issue, and we can simply see how different spots are affected at the same time.
</p>

  
<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p>
  This lab let us directly see the shape of magnetic fields, and the way that they connect opposite poles and repudiate like poles, while doing the same with other magnetic fields. Our hypothesis was mostly correct, with the lines being a lot more round than I expected but still good— the like poles also flattened out while the opposite ones connected, just as expected. Practical applications of magnetic fields include protecting all of Earth from deadly solar radiation… Compasses and levitating trains seem less exciting once you know that.
