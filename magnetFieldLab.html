<h1 style="text-align: center;">Mapping the Magnetic Field</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Galileo, [Partner(s)], 3-xx-24</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">(field map visuals were done by hand)</p>

<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>
This lab focused on mapping the magnetic field around permanent magnets. Magnetic fields are vector fields, meaning they have both direction and magnitude. They come from electric charges in motion or from materials like bar magnets. We used small compasses to trace the direction of the magnetic field lines around a single bar magnet, then again with two magnets in different orientations. Magnetic fields move from the north to the south pole of a magnet, and where field lines are close together, the strength is stronger. My hypothesis was that the compass would trace out curved field lines pointing from north to south, never overlapping, and that putting magnets in different configurations would change the shape of the field map.
</p>

<h2>Materials:</h2>
<ul class="d">
  <li>2 Bar Magnets</li>
  <li>A sheet of large paper</li>
  <li>Straight pins / push pins</li>
  <li>Sticky tape</li>
  <li>Compass</li>
  <li>Pencil</li>
</ul>

<h2>Procedure:</h2>
<p>
First clear away from the table top any magnets or iron or steel objects. Place your compass in the middle of the table and determine the direction of north.
</p>
<p>
Stack on top of one another one of the large sheets of paper for each person in your lab group (i.e., for you and one partner, stack two sheets). Put a bar magnet on top of the sheets, orienting the bar magnet so that its long dimension runs north-south. Turn the paper so that its long dimension is roughly perpendicular to the long dimension of the magnet. Look at the figure for clarification. It doesn’t really matter which end of the bar magnet is towards the north, pick either orientation you like.
Use some tape to secure the paper to the table, and trace the outline of the bar magnet with a pen or pencil. Identify (using your compass) which end of the bar magnet is the north pole. (Don’t trust any markings on the magnet, they have been known to be incorrect. Label on your paper which is the north pole of the magnet.
</p>
<p>
Now use your compass to create a map of the magnetic field lines around the magnet. Do this by placing the compass in a starting point (several suggested starting points are shown in the figure as dots), and turning the compass until the needle lines up with the two holes in the base. Once it’s aligned, stick a pencil into each hole and make a dot. Move the compass to one side or the other, but arrange it so one of the holes in the base is directly over one of your pencil dots. Align the needle with the holes and make another pencil dot. Continue this process in both directions to complete the field line. You might wish to connect the dots as you go along, or wait till later. In either case, when you do connect the dots, use an arrowhead to indicate the direction that the north (red) needle of the compass was pointing. Begin again at another convenient starting point and repeat the mapping process several times until you have traced out a few (need not be more than five or so) lines on each side of the magnet and a two or three lines near each end.
</p>
<p>
To allow both you and your partner(s) to have a copy of the field map, use a push pin and poke through the paper at each pencil dot so that you prick the sheet(s) below. This will allow an accurate copy of the original map to be produced.
</p>
<p>
After you’ve done the first map, obtain some fresh sheets of paper and map another case where you orient two bar magnets in a north-south direction, with like poles facing each other.

<h2>Data Analysis:</h2>
<ol class="d">
  <li><strong>Field Strength Indicator:</strong> The compass needle moved faster and more sharply in strong field areas, so the responsiveness of the compass gave a general idea of magnitude.</li>
  <li><strong>Line Spacing:</strong> Yes — closer lines = stronger field. Especially near the magnet ends.</li>
  <li><strong>Line Crossing:</strong> No — field lines never crossed, since the magnetic field can only have one direction at each point in space.</li>
  <li><strong>Two-Magnet Comparison:</strong>
    <br>- Like poles: field lines pushed away from each other and made a gap between magnets.
    <br>- Opposite poles: field lines connected directly from one magnet to the other in smooth arcs.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Error Analysis:</h2>
<p>
Several sources of error may have influenced the accuracy of our magnetic field maps. The compass needle could have been affected by small ferromagnetic materials in the lab environment, or by the Earth's magnetic field when further from the bar magnets. Inaccurate alignment of the compass or misreading the needle direction may have introduced minor deviations in field line tracing.
</p>

  
<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p>
This lab let us see magnetic fields in action. We saw that magnetic field lines always point from north to south, they bend depending on nearby fields, and where the field is stronger the lines are packed closer together. The compass was reliable for mapping field direction. The maps were different when magnets faced each other in different ways, which showed how vector fields can add or push away depending on orientation. Overall, this helped show that magnetic fields follow clear rules and can be visualized without fancy tools.
