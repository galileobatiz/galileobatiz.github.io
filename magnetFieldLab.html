<h1 style="text-align: center;">Mapping the Magnetic Field</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Galileo, Tori, Alyona, Jackson, 5-08-25</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">field map visuals were done by hand beautifully by Galileo</p>

<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>
</p>

<h2>Materials:</h2>
<ul class="d">
  <li>2 Bar Magnets</li>
  <li>A sheet of large paper</li>
  <li>Straight pins / push pins</li>
  <li>Sticky tape</li>
  <li>Compass</li>
  <li>Pencil</li>
</ul>

<h2>Procedure:</h2>
<p>
First clear away from the table top any magnets or iron or steel objects. Place your compass in the middle of the table and determine the direction of north.
</p>
<p>
Stack on top of one another one of the large sheets of paper for each person in your lab group (i.e., for you and one partner, stack two sheets). Put a bar magnet on top of the sheets, orienting the bar magnet so that its long dimension runs north-south. Turn the paper so that its long dimension is roughly perpendicular to the long dimension of the magnet. Look at the figure for clarification. It doesn’t really matter which end of the bar magnet is towards the north, pick either orientation you like.
Use some tape to secure the paper to the table, and trace the outline of the bar magnet with a pen or pencil. Identify (using your compass) which end of the bar magnet is the north pole. (Don’t trust any markings on the magnet, they have been known to be incorrect. Label on your paper which is the north pole of the magnet.
</p>
<p>
Now use your compass to create a map of the magnetic field lines around the magnet. Do this by placing the compass in a starting point (several suggested starting points are shown in the figure as dots), and turning the compass until the needle lines up with the two holes in the base. Once it’s aligned, stick a pencil into each hole and make a dot. Move the compass to one side or the other, but arrange it so one of the holes in the base is directly over one of your pencil dots. Align the needle with the holes and make another pencil dot. Continue this process in both directions to complete the field line. You might wish to connect the dots as you go along, or wait till later. In either case, when you do connect the dots, use an arrowhead to indicate the direction that the north (red) needle of the compass was pointing. Begin again at another convenient starting point and repeat the mapping process several times until you have traced out a few (need not be more than five or so) lines on each side of the magnet and a two or three lines near each end.
</p>
<p>
To allow both you and your partner(s) to have a copy of the field map, use a push pin and poke through the paper at each pencil dot so that you prick the sheet(s) below. This will allow an accurate copy of the original map to be produced.
</p>
<p>
After you’ve done the first map, obtain some fresh sheets of paper and map another case where you orient two bar magnets in a north-south direction, with like poles facing each other.

After you’ve done the first map, obtain some fresh sheets of paper and map another case where you orient two bar magnets in a north-south direction, with opposite poles facing each other.

<h2>Data Analysis:</h2>
<ol class="d">
  <li><strong>Was there anything about the behavior of the compass that would give some indication of the magnitude of the field at the location of the compass? :</strong> </li>
  <li><strong>Examine your field maps. Is there a relationship between how closely spaced the lines are and how strong the field (magnitude) is?</strong> </li>
  <li><strong>Did it appear that any of the field lines would cross over one another? Explain why: </strong>  </li>
  <li><strong>Describe the difference between the like-pole and unlike-pole field maps. </strong>
