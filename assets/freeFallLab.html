<h1>Physics Labs</h1>
  
<p> Freefall Lab <br>

<p>(graphics are a work in progress)</p>
<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>For our first lab we used a tissue box to determine the height of a staircase indirectly. <br>
  The staircase we measured is the outside staircase on the northeast face of Geffen Academy at Ucla <br>
  We held out the tissue box and dropped it off the staircase, using our knowledge of the acceleration of gravity here on earth <br>
  and the amount of time spent dropping in order to calculate the distance, using the kinematic equation known for displacement-time:<br>
  Δx = ut + (1/2)at^2      where <br>
  x is displacement <br>
  u is velocity at time initial(in this case 0) <br>
  a is acceleration(in this case is equal to g or the gravitational acceleration of earth, which is 9.81 m/s/s)<br>
  t is the time period in seconds <br>
  My hypothesis was that the building would be approximately 15 meters in height.
</p>

<h2>Procedure:</h2>
<p>
1. Visit the staircase on the northeastern face of Geffen Academy at Ucla, and have something or someone hold out a tissue box over the precipice of the highest accessible stair <br> 
2. Have a stopwatch used to time the period starting exactly when the tissue box is released to freefall down the height of the stairs, and end when the box hits the floor <br>
3. Write down the time recorded <br>
4. Get the tissue box back up the stairs to be dropped again, and repeat steps 1-3 10-20 more times. <br>
5. Average the recorded times in order to lessen the effects of unpredictable variables <br>
6. Using the resulting average as your time period, and your knowledge of gravitational accelleration, plug these numbers into the displacement time formula and solve for ∆x <br>
7. ∆x is the height of your staircase
</p>

<h2> Data: </h2>

<p> First drop: 1.5 <br>
2nd: 1.8 <br>
3rd: 1.3 <br>
4th: 1.5 <br>
5th: 1.6 <br>
6th: 1.6<br>
7th: 1.7 <br>
8th: 1.4<br> 
9th: 1.7<br>
10th: 1.6<br>  
</p>

<p>
The average of these numbers is their sum divided by the amount in the list, which in this case is about 1.57 <br>
1.57 becomes our time period, and we then plug that number into the displacement-time equation: <br>
 <br>
Δx = ut + (1/2)at^2 <br>
 <br>
in this scenario, u(velocity initial) is zero, meaning the first part of the equation doesnt do anything <br>
 a is gravitational acceleration, or 9.81 m/s/s <br>
 t is our calculated period of 1.57 <br>
 our equation then becomes <br>
  ∆x = 0(1.6) + (1/2)(9.81)(1.57)^2 <br>
  ∆x ≈ 12 meters <br>
  our change in height, or just height of the staircase is 12 meters. 
</p>
<h2>Materials:</h2>
<p> - Tissue box <br>
  - Method for recording time <br>
  - method for measuring time
</p>

  <h2> Error Analysis: </h2>
  
<p> We were likely unable to time the start of the stopwatch very accurately with the dropping of the box, neither were we likely able to <br> 
perfectly end the stopwatch along with when the box hit the floor. These could affect the times anywhere from 0.2 to 0.5 seconds based off of average human reaction time <br>
Air resistance could also hypothetically slow the tissue box to a speed below gravitational acceleration. Another slight error by humanness is our inability to hold up the box out <br>
over the precipice at a consistent height.</p>

  <h2> Conclusion: </h2>
  <p> In conclusion, our hypothesis that the building would be approximately 15 meters in height was correct, with a final measure of 12 meters. <br>
  This Lab is important in the larger context of the world because it demonstrates the ability of a physicist to measure things indirectly, which is important for <br>
  finding information about things we cannot access normally, like planets bajillions of miles away, or subatomic particles. </p>
