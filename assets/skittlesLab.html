<h1 style="text-align: center;">Simulation of Half-Life Using Skittles</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Gali — 1-22-26</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">(its giving radioactive decay)</p>

<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>In this lab, our goal was to simulate the way elements transmute in a period of time measured by half lives, a probabilistic and measurable phenomenon. We simulated this by using the most obvious and efficient way to make a 50% chance, which is obviously flipping skittles. These skittles are supposed to model the half live of C-14 as it turns into N-14, and I hypothesize that it will take rouphly 8 half lives for this to happen completely. </p>

<h3>How it works with the real particles:</h3>
<p>
<sup>14</sup><sub>6</sub>C is unstable due to having too many neutrons. One of the neutrons will change into a proton and produce a beta particle, leaving <sup>14</sup><sub>7</sub>N 
</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
<sup>14</sup><sub>6</sub>C &rarr; <sup>14</sup><sub>7</sub>N + <sup>0</sup><sub>-1</sub>e + v
</p>
<p>
According to common agreement, in 5,730 years each C-14 will have a 50% chance to change into N-14, leaving around half remaining. In another 5,730 years, another 50% of the remaining atoms will change, and it keeps going until all the C-14 has changed into N-14.
</p>

<h2>Materials:</h2>
<ul class="d">
  <li>Skittles (representing atoms)</li>
  <li>Cup</li>
  <li>Excel (for graphing)</li>
  <li>Paper towels</li>
</ul>

<h2>Procedure:</h2>
<ol class="a">
  <li>
    <strong>Setup</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Obtain a cup full of the skittles. We started with approximately 60 Skittles.</li>
      <li>Your total number of skittles represents 0 half-lives (Time = 0), with 100% of the radioactive particles present.</li>
      <li>C-14 atoms are represented by the "S" side (Heads). N-14 atoms are the blank side (Tails).</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Trial 1</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Pour all the skittles onto a paper towel.</li>
      <li>Count and record the number of C-14 that remain (Heads). These are still radioactive.</li>
      <li>The Tails are the N-14 atoms created (decayed). Remove them from the population.</li>
      <li>Collect all the remaining C-14 (Heads) and place them back in the cup.</li>
      <li>Repeat this process until all the C-14 has decayed into N-14.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Trial 2 & Analysis</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Place all original skittles back into the cup. Switch jobs with your lab partner.</li>
      <li>Redo the lab a 2nd time, recording the C-14 remaining after each half-life.</li>
      <li>Use Excel to plot the Average C-14 Remaining (y-axis) vs. Half Lives (x-axis).</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

</figure>

<h3>Graph Interpretation:</h3>
<p>Using the line of best fit from our average graph, we determined:</p>
<ul class="d">
    <li><strong>Years until C-14 is only 3% radioactive:</strong> ~35,065 years </li>
    <li><strong>Radioactive C-14 left after 0.5 Half Lives:</strong> ~45 atoms</li>
    <li><strong>C-14 remaining after 1.5 Half Lives:</strong> ~27 atoms(based on the graph!)</li>
    <li><strong>Years until 90% of atoms are radioactive (10% decayed):</strong> ~1,053.6 years</li>
    <li><strong>Age of a sample with 2 atoms remaining:</strong> ~34,380 years(again based on the graph!)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Post Lab Questions & Discussion:</h2>

<h3>C-14 Dating</h3>
<p><strong>C-14 is used to date objects from the last 50,000 years. How many half-lives of C-14 take place in 50,000 years?</strong></p>
<p>
  To find this, we divide the total time by the half-life of Carbon-14.
  <br>
  <em>50,000 years / 5,730 years = 8.72 Half-Lives</em>
  <br>
   To find it based on our own numbers, we divide the total time by the half-life of Carbon-14 we measured by our trendline(albeit flawed).
  <br>
  <em>50,000 years / 6,931 years = 7.2 Half-Lives</em>
  <br>
</p>

<h3>Decay</h3>
<p><strong>C-14 dating is based on the nuclear decay of C-14. During C-14 decay, explain what is produced?</strong></p>
<p>When C-14 decays, it turns into Nitrogen-14 (N-14). To make this happen, a neutron turns into a proton, ejecting a beta particle and a anti electron neutrino(to balance out the lepton count).</p>

<p><strong>Why is C-14 dating not used to date substances which are 12 years old or substances 1,000,000 yrs old?</strong></p>
<p> Because during those periods of times, you will not have a significant enough change in percentage/ratio by probability to certainly give a figure. In 12 years barely any C-14 will change, so you don’t get any results, and in 1000000 years too much decays leaving nothing to really measure.</p>

<h3>Radio Tracers </h3>
<p><strong> Why is it safe to take radio tracers?</strong></p>
<p>Radio tracers have, as you say in the next question, small amounts of radioactivity with short half lives, meaning that they end up releasing very little dangerous radiation for a short period of time, and quickly become not dangerous for your body at all.</p>

<p><strong> “Low Level Radioactive Waste” is generated from hospitals using radiotracers. It contains small amounts of radioactivity with short half lives. Usually it is buried in shallow landfill sites. Why is this a safe process?</strong></p>
<p> Similarly to why they are not dangerous in your body, these radiotracers quickly stabilize into non-radioactive isotopes without releasing too much dangerous radiation, making those landfills very safe.
</p>

  
<h3>Waste</h3>
<p><strong> “High-level Waste” contains the highly-radioactive fission products with long-lived radioactivity. It generates a considerable amount of heat and radiation and is disposed of deep underground.  Why bury the radioactive waste underground.  In your answer, mention the effect of soil on shielding and the half life of the material. 
</strong></p>
<p> This high level waste is much, much more dangerous because it can sometimes be releasing heat and radioactivity for millions or billions of years, so by burying it safely underground you solve two problems. First, the waste is physically as inaccessible as possible, preventing somebody from accidentally going up to it, or it leeching into the ground, or any physical interaction until the millions of years pass(which, in underground geology time is not that much). Secondly, radiation is a physical process that in a vacuum may reach very far, and while air does very little to stop it, earth does significantly better. As a matter of fact, the core and mantle of the earth rely on heat from decaying elements to stay nice and molten, and very little to none of that radiation reaches us on the crust. 
  </p>

<h3>Element Z</h3>
<p><strong>Here’s how ½ life dating works.  For example, make believe element Z occurs as  Z-10 (99% of the time) and Z-11 (1%).  That means for every 99, Z-10’s, there is 1, Z-11.  Let’s say that Z-11 is radioactive, and has a half life of 100 yrs.  That means that every 100 yrs, a Z-11 changes into another element.  If there is a sample of 12,000 Z’s, and only 3, Z-11’s remain, how many half lives & years old must the sample be</strong></p>
<p> Well, because there are 12,000 Z’s, and we know how often that Z is Z-11(1%), we can estimate that most probably in that sample there should be 120 Z-11’s naturally occurring. Because there are 3(and knowing that 3 is 2.5% of 120), we can say(using the equation 100*½^x=percentage remaining), that 5.3 half lives occurred. Multiplying this by 100 years per half life we can say the sample must be around 520 years old. 
</p>
  
<h3>Error Analysis</h3>
<p>
  While the Skittles generally followed the expected decay pattern, there were sources of error: First, we went with only 60 Skittles, a number low enough that a few lucky Skittles can skew the graph. With larger sample sizes (like 1,000+) we could make smoother curves that align closer with the theoretical 50/50 probability. Second, some skittles are liekely unevenly weighted, such that the final probability isn't even 50/50, but completely sqewed. Laslty, there's probably some error in our picking of the skittles due to the occasional indistinguishability of the S logo, introducing judgement calls into our decision, which is not probabilistic. Assuming we have free will, anyways.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p> In conclusion, my hypothesis somehow ended up being exactly right. This is likely due to a well placed educated guess, but the fact that real math suggests this also makes half lives an extremely useful tool for measuring the age of objects anywhere in the universe, from carbon dating manuscripts here on earth to dating comments usining aluminium. The way that the random probabilites add up into measurable outcomes is also a good way for us to begin to conceptualize how atoms generally behave.
