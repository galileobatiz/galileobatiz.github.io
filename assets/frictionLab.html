  Friction Lab</h1>

<h2>Introduction:</h2>
  
 <p class="w3-large"> In this lab we explored whether or not banana peels are more slippery than other things to learn the nature of friction, and how the intensity of it is inherent to the material being tested. We tested the kinetic frictional force of a banana vs scissors vs an eraser. My hypothesis was that the banana would be less slippery than the scissors but more than the eraser.</p>
  <p> The equation we used to find the coefficient of fricion was ùö∫F=ma=‚àÖN=Fpull-Ffr or Fpull = Ffr = uk(mg) </p>

<h2>Materials:</h2>  
<ul class="d">
  <li>Electronic Scale</li>
  <li>Spring Scale</li>
  <li>various 20g masses</li>
  <li>Banana peel</li>
  <li>Eraser</li>
  <li>Scissors</li>
  <li>Person to pull at a constant rate</li>
  <li>method of recording readings from spring scale</li>
</ul>

  
<h2>Procedure:</h2>
<ol class="a">
  <li>Measure the mass of each object alone, without masses added to them, and record them.</li>
  <li>Place one of your masses on top of one of your testing objects. Record the total mass of your experimental object.</li>
  <li>Attach the spring scale to the mass/object combination.</li>
  <li>Pull the mass/object combination on a flat cement surface at a constant velocity. Record the reading on the spring scale (in Newtons).</li>
  <li>Repeat steps 5-7 with the rest of your masses. There should be 10 measurements total per object you are testing, one per mass that you add.</li>
  <li>Repeat all measurements for each object to be tested. Again, there should be 10 masses total which are coupled with each object, so that each object has 10 measurements made.</li>

</ol>

<h2> Data and Analysis: </h2>

<p> After frictioning some bananas we found the following results using the spring weight and electronic balance. The slope of the graph Y is equal to Fpull/Fweight is equal to uk. The slope of each graph is the coefficient of friction of the object.

<img src="/images/scissorGraph.png" alt="scissor graph" width="500" height="1000">

 <p class="w3-large"> As expected, a higher weight meant a higher pulling force, but the ratios remained somewhat consistently the same, with the items having the following coefficients of friction. Eraser: 0.48, Scissor: 0.22, Banana: 0.77</p>

  <h2> Error Analysis: </h2>
  
<p class="w3-large"> Possible errors include our method of measuring Fpull, which was flawed because we were unable to pull the object at a constant velocity, nor measure very precisely the reading of our spring scale. We could fix this in so many different ways, but the goal would be a more precise scale or method of pulling at a constant velocity. There is also some merit to doing more measurements.</p>

  <h2> Conclusion: </h2>
 <p class="w3-large"> In conclusion, the bananas were actually the object with the highest coefficient of kinetic friction out of all of the objects, going against my hypothesis that it would be the middle one. Our data may not be perfect, but the difference was definetely noticeable between each object, with the banana peel being the most frictitious as opposed to the what cartoons tell us that it should be the least. The real world applications of being able to measure coefficient of friction has uses like tires, clothing technology, sports. </p>
