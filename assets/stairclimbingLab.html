<h1><br> 
  <br>
 Stair Climb Lab</h1>

<p>(graphics are a work in progress)</p>
<h2>Introduction:</h2>
  
 <p class="w3-large">The goal of this lab is to learn more about force (Newtons), work (Joules), and power (Watts), and use our knowledge of the three  to see how much effort it takes to get up the stairs in terms of caloric content of a peanut and the power emmitted by a lightbulb. We did this by climbing up the stairs ourselves and using infrmation like the dimentions of the stairs and time with the equations W = fd and P = W/t in order to determine how much effort we put in. We then used unit conversions in order to turn it into peanuts and lightbulbs. </p>
  <p>I hypothesise that we will use 3 peanuts and 10 seconds of lightbulb per staircase.</p>

<h2>Materials:</h2>  
<ul class="d">
  <li>scale</li>
  <li>metric ruler</li>
  <li>Stopwatch</li>
  <li>stairs</li>
</ul>

  
<h2>Procedure:</h2>
<ol class="a">
  <li>Measure your weight using the scale. Weight should be expressed in newtons. Convert pounds to newtons by multiplying pounds by 4.45. Convert kilograms to newtons with Newton's 2nd Law (F=ma). Multiply kilograms by the acceleration due to gravity.</li>
  <li>Measure the height of one stair (in meters).</li>
  <li>Count the number of steps you will be climbingâ€”and multiply this by the height of a step to find the total height, in meters.</li>
  <li>Climb the stairs as quickly and as safely as possible while your partner times you. Record the time as accurately as possible. CAUTION: Be very careful. Make sure you hold onto the hand rail.</li>
  <li>Repeat step #4 twice, completing two more runs. CAUTION: Be careful, if you are feeling overly exerted, do not continue.</li>
  <li>Switch roles with your partner and repeat steps #4 & #5.</li>

</ol>

<h2> Data and Analysis: </h2>

<p> After Gali and Jackson went up the stairs a bunch of times(with Gali being much faster obviously)

<p> As seen in the calculations, the final lightbulbs of energy we ran was about 5 and about 1/10th of a peanut 
</p>
  <h2> Error Analysis: </h2>
  
<p class="w3-large"> Possible errors could include timing with stopwatches which could be fixed by an automatic release system or Tori just getting really lucky. Another main issue could be the fact that the stairs were bent and we kind of had to slow down at some points, or just the fact we were rushing at all which created a lack of realism. This could be fixed by timing a diverse range of random people in a better stairway.</p>

  <h2> Conclusion: </h2>
 <p class="w3-large"> In conclusion, I seem to have grossly overestimated how much effort goes into walking up the stairs in terms of peanuts and slightly underestimated in terms of lightbulbs. The ability to measure how much energy something uses indirectly though for example in terms of a remote robot rover or just a hike could be useful to plan how much fuel you are going to supply. I really am surprised by how few calories I burned. Does my maintenance caloric intake really make up such a great part of my energy? If it does, why can't I go up the stairs for hours? An hour would theoretically only burn about 60 peanuts which I easily surpass in a day. </p>
