<p>(graphics are a work in progress)</p>
<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>
The objective of this lab is to better learn to calculate resultant vectors using the flights of Paper planes. <br>
We tried to figure out how to maximize the magnitude of the resultant vector of our paper plane using folding techniques. <br>
Our hypothesis was that our paper plane would not be a maximized design, due to its irregular folds and our subpar throwing. <br>
 <br>
 The equations we used to find our resultant vector for each throw were  <br>
  the Inverse Trigonometric functions, specifically arctan(x/y)= resultant angle, in order to find the direction or angle of our vector <br>
  the Pythagorean theorem (x^2 + y^2 = Resultant^2), in order to find the magnitude of the resultant <br>
  both of these equations give information of the resultant when only given the forward and sideways legnths of the throws <br>
</p>

<h2>Materials:</h2>
<p>
- regulation letter size paper<br>
- method of recording <br>
- way of measuring distance
</p>

  
<h2>Procedure:</h2>
<p>
1. Begin by folding a sheet of regulation letter paper into an airplane, our group used the design known as The Ring, but any may be used<br> 
2. Mark a spot on the ground in a clear area, noting a direction.<br>
3. Have a person or paper airplane throwing device throw in the direction of the mark on the ground <br>
4. When the airplane has landed, have the person walk forward along the marked direction until they reach intersection of 
the ray going in the indicated direction of the mark on the ground and the perpendicular line connecting the paper airplane to the ray <br>
5. Measure the distance between the person and the marked spot as your y, and the person and the airplane as your x<br>
6. return to the mark, carrying your airpane with you, and mark down your x and y on a chart, solving for your resultant using the aformentioned equations<br>
7. Repeat steps 3-6 3-20 times

<h2> Data and Analysis: </h2>

<img src="/images/paperPlaneGraph.png" alt="paperPlaneGraph" width="500" height="300"> 
<p>
Our plane resulted in an average distance of about 4.8m with a 15 degree stray from directly forwards<br>
</p>

<h2> Error Analysis: </h2>
  
<p> 
Our paper airplane throwing technique was not very good, so the plane often veered in a direction and looped back around or just went straight up and then crashed downwards.<br> 
This could be fixed with practice or a more consistent way to throw like a machine. Our plane wasnt very well folded, which could be fixed by using stiffer paper or a much more 
meticulous construction. Our environment also sometimes led to incorrect data, because the plane often hit the wall and slid along, which could be fixed by using a more open space.<br>
</p>

<h2> Conclusion: </h2>
<p> 
In conclusion, our analysis was correct. Our plane failed to go very straight or very far at all, and had flaws with it's construction.<br>
Our goal was achieved, and we improved our understanding and execution of the calculation of 2d vectors. <br>
This skill is useful in the real world because many 2d calculations are much easier with separation of the x and y axis, and it is important to be <br>
able to inderectly measure things because much of our universe is not easily accessible.
