<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>For our first lab we used a tissue box to determine the height of a staircase indirectly. <br>
  The staircase we measured is the outside staircase on the northeast face of Geffen Academy at Ucla <br>
  We held out the tissue box and dropped it off the staircase, using our knowledge of the acceleration of gravity here on earth <br>
  and the amount of time spent dropping in order to calculate the distance, using the kinematic equation known for displacement-time:<br>
  Î”x = ut + (1/2)at^2 where <br>
  x is displacement <br>
  u is velocity at time initial(in this case 0) <br>
  a is acceleration(in this case is equal to g or the gravitational acceleration of earth, which is 9.81 m/s/s)<br>
  t is the time period in seconds <br>
  My hypothesis was that the building would be approximately 15 meters in height.
