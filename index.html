<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>For our first lab we used a tissue box to determine the height of a staircase indirectly. <br>
  The staircase we measured is the outside staircase on the northeast face of Geffen Academy at Ucla <br>
  We held out the tissue box and dropped it off the staircase, using our knowledge of the acceleration of gravity here on earth <br>
  and the amount of time spent dropping in order to calculate the distance, using the kinematic equation known for displacement-time:<br>
  Δx = ut + (1/2)at^2      where <br>
  x is displacement <br>
  u is velocity at time initial(in this case 0) <br>
  a is acceleration(in this case is equal to g or the gravitational acceleration of earth, which is 9.81 m/s/s)<br>
  t is the time period in seconds <br>
  My hypothesis was that the building would be approximately 15 meters in height.
</p>

<h2>Procedure:</h2>
<p>
1. Visit the staircase on the northeastern face of Geffen Academy at Ucla, and have something or someone hold out a tissue box over the precipice of the highest accessible stair <br> 
2. Have a stopwatch used to time the period starting exactly when the tissue box is released to freefall down the height of the stairs, and end when the box hits the floor <br>
3. Write down the time recorded <br>
4. Get the tissue box back up the stairs to be dropped again, and repeat steps 1-3 10-20 more times. <br>
5. Average the recorded times in order to lessen the effects of unpredictable variables <br>
6. Using the resulting average as your time period, and your knowledge of gravitational accelleration, plug these numbers into the displacement time formula and solve for ∆x <br>
7. ∆x is the height of your staircase
