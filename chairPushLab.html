 Chair Push Lab</h1>

<h2>Introduction:</h2>
  
 <p class="w3-large"> In this lab we attempted to learn more about momentum and its conservation in a system by throwing a medicine ball to a person in order to create an inelastic collision. We then used the information we got out of that to determine the speed of the ball before it is caught by the person. My hypothesis was that the intial velocity of the ball would be 5 m/s
  </p>
  <p> The relevant equations were m1*v1i+m2​*v2i=m1​*v1f+m2​*v2f (elastic) and m1*v1i+m2*v2i=(m1+m2)vf*m1*v1i+m2*v2i =(m1+m2​)*vf (in-elastic). </p>
  
<h2>Materials:</h2>  
<ul class="d">
  <li>Medicine ball</li>
  <li>Thrower</li>
  <li>Yona</li>
  <li>Yard stick</li>
  <li>Timer</li>
  <li>Rolly Chair</li>
  <li>notebook to write down measurement</li>
</ul>

  
<h2>Procedure:</h2>
<ol class="a">
  <li>Start by placing the rolly chair at the start of a yardstick with the end pointed in any direction</li>
  <li>with a thrower holding a medicine ball at the opposite direction of the yardstick pointing out from the chair, have them throw the medicine ball to the yona in the chair, at the midsection area(mind the knees)</li>
  <li>measure how far back yona and the chair get pushed and amount of time it takes to get there, and record both the time and distance</li>
  <li>repeat steps 1 to 3, 10 times</li>
  <li>calculate how fast the initial velocity of the chair with yona was and plug into conservation of momentum equations</li>
  <li>find the velocity of the ball using the momentum equations and proove that it was inelastic colision by calculating kinetic energy as well.</li>

</ol>

<h2> Data and Analysis: </h2>

<p> After chairing and mathing 
</p>
<img src="chairPushLab.jpeg" alt="Chair Push Lab" width="800" height="550"> 
<p> As seen in the calculations, my hypothesis was surprisingly close and the velocity of the ball was 4.7 m/s
</p>
  <h2> Error Analysis: </h2>
  
<p class="w3-large"> There was obviously the usual errors with possibly imprecise measurement of timing and distance, and this could have been fixed by really good luck or some sort of automatic trigger for when the chair starts and stops moving. There also could have been some cushioning when yona caught the ball and it could have been fixed by yona either just allowing the ball to hit her or an alternate machine or something that could sit in the chair and take the impact inelastically. Lastly, the speed at which the ball was thrown could have varied per throw but that could be fixed by an automatic throwing system like the ones we use in baseball.  </p>

  <h2> Conclusion: </h2>
 <p class="w3-large"> In conclusion, my hypothesis that the ball would have an initial velocity of 5 m/s was surprisingly correct compared to the real 4.7m/s. Learning more about collisions and conservation of momentum has many real world applications, from astronomy and the collisions of planets and stars to smaller scale real world applications like car crashes and games like curling. </p>
