<h1><br> 
  <br>
Roller Coaster Lab</h1>
  <p> <br>
Galileo, Victoria, Alyona, Jackson <br>
2-22-25 </p>

<p>(graphics are a no longer really working in progress)</p>
<h2>Introduction:</h2>
  
 <p class="w3-large">The goal of this lab was to figure out how hight we needed to make the descent of a hot wheel roller coaster in order for the little car to successfully loop a loop theoretically and then compare our math to the real world as well as compare it to a roller coaster without a loop in order to see who wins. We used our knowledge of kinematics and new information about conservation of energy in order to attempt and prove our hypothesis that the car will go further when the loop de loop is not part of its journey.</p>
  <p>Pertinent Formulas/Laws: <br>
<br>
Etot,initial = Etot,final<br>
PEi + KEi= PEf + KEf <br>

*Beginning at rest, KEi = 0*<br>
mgh1 = mgh2 + 1/2mv2 <br>
v2 = gr<br>
Fc = mv2/r<br>
Fc = mg<br>
mg = mv2/r<br>
mgh1 = mgh2 + 1/2mv2 <br>
mgh1 = mgh2 + 1/2m(gr) <br>
 h1 = 2r + 1/2 (r)<br>
h2 = 2r<br>
h1 = 2.5(r)  <br>
<br>
In addition, you will need the formula from projectile motion:<br>
x = (vlaunch*cos) * t<br>
And:<br>
 = tan-1(height of ramp/length of base of ramp)<br>
  
  </p>

<h2>Materials:</h2>  
<ul class="d">
  <li>hot wheels set</li>
  <li>metric ruler</li>
  <li>Stopwatch</li>
</ul>

  
<h2>Procedure:</h2>
<ol class="a">
  <li>Split into groups of 3-5</li>
  <li>Set up the Hot Wheels set such that there is one loop-de-loop, which leads into a ramp from which the car will jump</li>
  <li> Find the minimum height your car will need to begin at in order to make it around the loop you have constructed, using Conservation of Energy and circular motion (as outlined in the formulae above)</li>
  <li> Find the velocity your car will be going at the bottom of the loop-the-loop setup, assuming you start from the height you calculated in step #3</li>
  <li>See if your predicted height will allow the care to travel around the loop. If not, raise the starting height until the car does make it around the loop safely. Record your actual starting height here, along with the angle of the ramp off of which the car will be jumping</li>
  <li>Find the velocity your car will be going at the bottom of this new loop-the-loop setup, assuming you start from the height you measured in step #5</li>
  <li> Let the car go down the descent, through the loop-de-loop, and then jump off the ramp. Measure how far away from the base of the Hot Wheels set the car lands, as well as the time it takes to travel during the jump(10 times)</li>
  <li>Find the average distance/time the car traveled</li>
  <li> Find the initial velocity the car had while jumping off the ramp, using the equation of projectile motion above.</li>
  <li>  Set up a simpler Hot Wheels construction, such that the car begins from the same height at which you started for the loop the loop setup, and then jumps off a ramp of the same length, and raised at the same angle. Now, however, just let the car descend and jump.</li>
  <li> Repeat steps #7 - 10 </li>

</ol>

<h2> Data and Analysis: </h2>

<p> After Gali held up the hot wheels structure helpfully and reliably and Yona did her best but not quite enough to drop the car itself(thankfully Gali is multipurpose and was able to drop the car too)

  <img src="hotWheelsLab2.png" alt="info noloop" width="476" height="401"> 
<p> As seen in the calculations, the averrage final distance of the loop de loop one(0.59) is less than the average distance of the non loop de loop one(3.5)
</p>
  <h2> Error Analysis: </h2>
  
<p class="w3-large"> Possible errors could include timing with stopwatches which could be fixed by an automatic release system or Yona just getting really lucky. Another main issue could be the fact that Gali might have moved during the process of holding up the roller coaster which could have been fixed by either a lot of tape or some higher quality of tracks, and that the car was likely not being dropped at consistent heights which an automatic release system or just very precise marker could have fixed. The track was also very bumpy which could have slowed down the car a lot, but could be fixed with either some modifications to the set like tape and sanding and hot glue or a new set with more precise building mechanisms.</p>

  <h2> Conclusion: </h2>
 <p class="w3-large"> In conclusion, we were in fact right and the non loop de loop roller coaster went further. I guess that it would be due in big proportion to friction which would have slowed the car down to a further degree over a longer path which the loop de loop was. Understanding the energy of the something as it goes through a known path has many applications in the real world including the obvious one of roller coasters but also designing highways, playgrounds, train tracks, and even baggage claim areas.</p>
