<h1><br> 
  <br>
Roller Coaster Lab</h1>
  <p> <br>
Galileo, Victoria, Alyona, Jackson <br>
2-22-25 </p>

<p>(graphics are a no longer really working in progress)</p>
<h2>Introduction:</h2>
  
 <p class="w3-large">The goal of this lab was to figure out how hight we needed to make the descent of a hot wheel roller coaster in order for the little car to successfully loop a loop. We used our knowledge of kinematics and new information about conservation of energy in order to attempt and prove our hypothesis that the car will go further when the loop de loop is not part of its journey.</p>
  <p>Pertinent Formulas/Laws: <br>
<br>
Etot,initial = Etot,final<br>
PEi + KEi= PEf + KEf <br>

*Beginning at rest, KEi = 0*<br>
mgh1 = mgh2 + 1/2mv2 <br>
v2 = gr<br>
Fc = mv2/r<br>
Fc = mg<br>
mg = mv2/r<br>
mgh1 = mgh2 + 1/2mv2 <br>
mgh1 = mgh2 + 1/2m(gr) <br>
 h1 = 2r + 1/2 (r)<br>
h2 = 2r<br>
h1 = 2.5(r)  <br>
<br>
In addition, you will need the formula from projectile motion:<br>
x = (vlaunch*cos) * t<br>
And:<br>
 = tan-1(height of ramp/length of base of ramp)<br>
  
  </p>

<h2>Materials:</h2>  
<ul class="d">
  <li>hot wheels set</li>
  <li>metric ruler</li>
  <li>Stopwatch</li>
</ul>

  
<h2>Procedure:</h2>
<ol class="a">
  <li>Split into groups of 3-5</li>
  <li>Set up the Hot Wheels set such that there is one loop-de-loop, which leads into a ramp from which the car will jump</li>
  <li> Find the minimum height your car will need to begin at in order to make it around the loop you have constructed, using Conservation of Energy and circular motion (as outlined in the formulae above)</li>
  <li> Find the velocity your car will be going at the bottom of the loop-the-loop setup, assuming you start from the height you calculated in step #3</li>
  <li>See if your predicted height will allow the care to travel around the loop. If not, raise the starting height until the car does make it around the loop safely. Record your actual starting height here, along with the angle of the ramp off of which the car will be jumping</li>
  <li>Find the velocity your car will be going at the bottom of this new loop-the-loop setup, assuming you start from the height you measured in step #5</li>
  <li> Let the car go down the descent, through the loop-de-loop, and then jump off the ramp. Measure how far away from the base of the Hot Wheels set the car lands, as well as the time it takes to travel during the jump(10 times)</li>
  <li>Find the average distance/time the car traveled</li>
  <li> Find the initial velocity the car had while jumping off the ramp, using the equation of projectile motion above.</li>
  <li>  Set up a simpler Hot Wheels construction, such that the car begins from the same height at which you started for the loop the loop setup, and then jumps off a ramp of the same length, and raised at the same angle. Now, however, just let the car descend and jump.</li>
  <li> Repeat steps #7 - 10 </li>

</ol>

<h2> Data and Analysis: </h2>

<p> After Gali held up the hot wheels structure helpfully and reliably and Yona did her best but not quite enough to drop the car itself(thankfully Gali is multipurpose and was able to drop the car too)

<p> As seen in the calculations, the final lightbulbs of energy we ran was about 5 and about 1/10th of a peanut 
</p>
  <h2> Error Analysis: </h2>
  
<p class="w3-large"> Possible errors could include timing with stopwatches which could be fixed by an automatic release system or Tori just getting really lucky. Another main issue could be the fact that the stairs were bent and we kind of had to slow down at some points, or just the fact we were rushing at all which created a lack of realism. This could be fixed by timing a diverse range of random people in a better stairway.</p>

  <h2> Conclusion: </h2>
 <p class="w3-large"> In conclusion, I seem to have grossly overestimated how much effort goes into walking up the stairs in terms of peanuts and slightly underestimated in terms of lightbulbs. The ability to measure how much energy something uses indirectly though for example in terms of a remote robot rover or just a hike could be useful to plan how much fuel you are going to supply. I really am surprised by how few calories I burned. Does my maintenance caloric intake really make up such a great part of my energy? If it does, why can't I go up the stairs for hours? An hour would theoretically only burn about 60 peanuts which I easily surpass in a day. </p>
